- When gaining Stormkeeper the player gains 2 stacks of the Stormkeeper buff similar to when the player uses the ability.
- When starting a fight Stormkeeper will automatically be gained after 0-5 seconds.
  The exact timing is random.
  After this initial random delay the tier set will attempt to grant Stormkeeper every 40 seconds.
  In case a player casted Stormkeeper buff is active the tier buff application is delayed and attempted again after 5 seconds.
  This delay and re-attempt is repeated until the tier effect can be successfully applied.
  The delay does not affect the next cycle start. E.g.:
  - 0s fight starts 
  - random 3s tier Stormkeeper
  - 43s tier Stormkeeper
  - 83s tier Stormkeeper attempt, but player Stormkeeper is active
  - 88s next tier Stormkeeepr attempt, this time successful
  - 123s tier Stormkeeper

- Casting {{ site.data.spell.lava_burst }} has an ever increasing chance to trigger {{ site.data.talent.ascendance }}.
- Starting with a double 0% chance then incrementing by 1% per try. This results in a chance chain of
  0%, 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%,... This averages out to the same known 7% chance and uptime.
- This change removes the probability of double procs (without {{ site.data.talent.further_beyond }}) and droughts.
