- 4p has been redesigned, previously was: "For 10 seconds after using {{ site.data.spell.primordial_wave }}, whenever you consume {{ site.data.spell.lava_surge }}, your next {{ site.data.spell.lb }} or {{ site.data.spell.cl }} is instant cast and deals 25% increased damage".
- It is now: "When consuming {{ site.data.spell.primordial_wave }} and for 10 seconds afterwards, {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} burns your target for 25% additional damage over 4 seconds, and for 10 seconds each cast of {{ site.data.spell.cl }} causes your next {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} to hit up to 3 additional targets affected by your {{ site.data.spell.fs }} for 100% of normal damage".

# General Shaman Changes

## Splintered Elements

- {{ site.data.spell.splinter }} now grants you 20% Haste plus an additional 4% Haste per extra target hit by {{ site.data.spell.primordial_wave }}, rather than 10% Haste per target hit.

- This change primarily buffs {{ site.data.spell.splinter }} in Single Target and nerfs it at 5 and more targets. This is overall a good change for builds using {{ site.data.spell.splinter }}, as Single Target damage was their main issue.


Target count | Haste gained before | Haste gained now
--- | --- | ---
1 | 10% | 20%
2 | 20% | 24%
3 | 30% | 28%
4 | 40% | 32%
5 | 50% | 36%
6 | 60% | 40%

## Further Beyond

- {{ site.data.spell.fb }} can now only increase the duration of {{ site.data.spell.fb }} by up to 100% of the original duration of {{ site.data.spell.asc }}.

*Note: From early testing, this seems to double {{ site.data.spell.asc }}'s uptime for build that pick {{ site.data.spell.fb }}, compared to builds who do not, resulting in an average uptime of 45%.*

## Primordial Wave

- {{ site.data.spell.primordial_wave }} can no longer be used to heal a friendly ally, it is now only an offensive spell for Elemental Shaman.

*Note: This is mostly a Quality of Life change, making it impossible to accidently waste a {{ site.data.spell.pw }} by targeting an ally*

## Elemental Blast

- {{ site.data.spell.eb }} can now refresh and extend the duration of the Haste, Critical Strike, and Mastery effects to up to 130% of the base 10 second duration, but will still prefer to apply a buff that you don’t already have.

## Mana Changes

- {{ site.data.spell.mana_spring }} now restores 100 mana per {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} (was 150).

*Note: This is due to a healer nerf, see this [Blue Post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/healing-throughput-and-mana-generation-in-guardians-of-the-dream/1666444).*
