Hey ho,

in this blogpost I'll summarize all changes 8.1 will bring to our spec.
This post however won't be a guide to how to play. So please read the actual guide pages
for that.

Time to dig in.


## Base spells

### Capacitor Totem

- Range: 35y -> 40y

Some more consistency for our spells. Offensive utility spells still have 30y range.


### Earthbind Totem

- Range: 35y -> 40y

Some more consistency for our spells. Offensive utility spells still have 30y range.


### Earth Shock

- Spellpower coefficient: 250% -> 210% (-16%)
- Reason: See {{ site.data.spell.lb }} section for more information
- New animation:

### Earthquake

- Unchanged

**Side note**: The spellpower coefficient change you might've seen is just the application of a live hotfix to the base spell. Resulting in no change overall.


### Fire Elemental

- Unchanged

**Side note**: Changes you might've seen about the CD becoming a recharge has no effect whatsoever for us. Thus our base CD is unchanged.


### Flame Shock

- Duration: 18 seconds -> 24 seconds
- Damage per tick: unchanged

We can finally use {{ site.data.spell.asc }} without having to refresh {{ site.data.spell.fs }} right before going into the CD. And we no longer have to wait for the CD of {{ site.data.spell.fs }} to finish at the beginning of the fight, but can actually just head into {{ site.data.spell.asc }}. But should we use {{ site.data.spell.asc }}? Check out the guide!

**Side note**: While datamining showed a spellpower coefficient change in the tooltip, this change only ensured that each damage tick remains as strong as with the 18 seconds duration. Therefore {{ site.data.spell.fs }} will provide the same DPS but lasts longer, which of course frees up a global cooldown here and there, which adds up over time.


### Lava Burst

- Behavior: {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} now checks on impact instead of cast success whether {{ site.data.spell.fs }} is on the target.

This means that we can actually open the fight with a precasted {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}, followed by {{ site.data.spell.fs }} on pull, to still ensure a 100% crit of {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}. We can now switch targets one cast earlier than before.


### Lightning Bolt

- Spellpower coefficient: 58% -> 70.4% (+21.38%)

<div class="blizzard-post">
    <ul>
        <li>Shifted some damage from {{ site.data.spell.es }} to {{ site.data.spell.lb }}.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Elemental Shaman is the only lightning based spell caster. However, over time, {{ site.data.spell.lb }} has gone from being a significant portion of your total damage to one of your least damaging abilities. It should be a powerful and effective spell for you to cast, and not something that feels like a burden to your rotation. {{ site.data.spell.es }} will still be your hardest hitting spell, but {{ site.data.spell.lb }} should feel a bit better as part of your rotation.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</div>

As slanderman mentioned before, this indirectly buffs {{ site.data.spell.tm }}, {{ site.data.spell.se }}, and {{ site.data.spell.sk }}. Furthermore this strengthens our intended immobility, because our stand-still filler becomes more powerful than our movement filler ({{ site.data.spell.frs }}).

**Side note**: When {{ site.data.spell.lb }} is buffed but {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} is left untouched, then it might change how we handle our priority list during {{ site.data.spell.se }} uptime. Check out the priority list page for more information regarding that.


## Talents

New talent tree layout (selected column to enhance readability, this is not a suggestion):

![The new talent tree layout](/assets/img/blog/8_1_28657_talent_tree.PNG)

Exposed Elements and High Voltage are gone.
{{ site.data.spell.er }} replaces Exposed Elements in the level 15 row. The new talent {{ site.data.spell.sop }} joins in the otherwise empty left level 90 talent slot.
{{ site.data.spell.mote }} replaces high Voltage in row 60. The new talent {{ site.data.spell.ctt }} joins in the otherwise empty middle level 30 talent slot.

The following talent mentions are ordered by their position in the talent tree.


### -Exposed Elements

Gone.


### Elemental Blast

- Overload Mechanic: Overloads of this spell now always generate a different buff than the primary cast.

This means that this talent becomes slightly more powerful. However because our base cast {{ site.data.spell.lb }} got buffed, this talent suffers a loss overall.


### +Call the Thunder

- Max Maelstrom: +30
- {{ site.data.spell.es }} and {{ site.data.spell.eq }} cost: 50 Maelstrom

Consistent but undertuned.


### -High Voltage

Gone.


### Master of the Elements

- Mechanic: affects {{ site.data.spell.eq }}, too

However, we still don't want to cast {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} during heavy AoE (>= 4 targets).


### Wind Rush Totem

- New animation: ![new wind rush totem effect indication](/assets/img/blog/8_1_wind_rush_totem_indicator.PNG)


### +Surge of Power

- 1 of 4 selectable mechanics after casting {{ site.data.spell.es }}
- effect defined by your next cast
- {{ site.data.spell.fs }}: spread {{ site.data.spell.fs }} to one additional target within 8y
- {{ site.data.spell.lb }}: this {{ site.data.spell.lb }} triggers 1-3 additional Overloads (80%&nbsp;1, 18%&nbsp;2, 2%&nbsp;3)
- {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}: reduce the remaining CD of {{ site.data.spell.fe }}/{{ site.data.spell.se }} by 6 seconds
- {{ site.data.spell.frs }}: freeze your target for 6 seconds

We're only interested in the {{ site.data.spell.lb }} and {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} effects because we generally don't want to cast {{ site.data.spell.es }} during any form of multi target fights.


### Icefury

- Buff strength: 100% -> 200%
- Mechanic: empowered {{ site.data.spell.frs }} generate 8 Maelstrom, {{ site.data.spell.if }} generates 15 -> 25 Maelstrom


### Stormkeeper

- Mechanic: empowered {{ site.data.spell.lb }} also deal 150% more damage

This makes {{ site.data.spell.sk }} a valuable single target talent. Greet our new Overlord.


## Azerite

### +Ancient Ankh Talisman

- Mechanic: While Ankh is available you have x more life; while at 100% life Ankh CD recharges 100% faster

While this might sound fun, it's actually pretty hard to gauge how much of a fight you're actually at 100% life. If you have a pocket healer this trait might help, but even if you have, you'd still have ankh at most every 15 minutes. Which equals to every 2-3 tries. Is this good? No, you still can't reliably incorporate it into your strategy.


### Ancestral Resonance

- Mechanic: {{ site.data.spell.bloodlust }} and such effects (except for drums so far) last 50% longer (60 seconds instead of 40 seconds); you have a chance to get a Mastery proc, chance is increased during {{ site.data.spell.bloodlust }}

Our new **have once** trait. 50 seconds {{ site.data.spell.bloodlust }} has been and will always be juicy. Because you usually use this ability when most necessary or valuable getting more consistent procs during that time is a nice addition, even though it's still only Mastery. At least we can no longer accidentally overcap Mastery with this trait.


### Natural Harmony

- Unchanged

**Side note**: You might've seen some value increases in datamining. Those are just the application of a live hotfix we've had for quite some time now. The trait is not receiving any change in 8.1. Just its base effect is adjusted to the level of the hotfix.


### +Tectonic Thunder

- Mechanic: {{ site.data.spell.eq }} deals an immediate x additional damage; casting {{ site.data.spell.eq }} has a 25% chance to make your next {{ site.data.spell.cl }} instant

Very powerful pure AoE trait. When stacking this you could actually replace {{ site.data.spell.es }} in single target with {{ site.data.spell.eq }}. But do you want to stack an AoE trait until you can get a very marginal single target gain, instead of just using a general trait that helps in all situations? Something for everyone themselves to decide. Anyway, if anyone wants to run a returning meme: stack this trait three times and use {{ site.data.spell.eq }} in single target. - I wouldn't be suprised to see some diminishing return being added to this trait soon, so meme while you can.


### -Rumbling Tremors

Gone. Replaced by Tectonic Thunder.
