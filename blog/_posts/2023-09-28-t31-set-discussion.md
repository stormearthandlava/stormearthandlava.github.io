## T31 effects
> (2) Set Bonus: {{ site.data.spell.primordial_wave }} also casts an {{ site.data.spell.eb }} at the target at 70% effectiveness, and grants you all three {{ site.data.spell.eb }} bonus effects for 10.0 seconds.

> (4) Set Bonus: {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} burns your target for 10% additional damage over 4 seconds, and after consuming {{ site.data.spell.primordial_wave }}, your next 2 casts of {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} also hit up to 3 additional targets affected by your {{ site.data.spell.fs }} for 65% of normal damage.

First things first. Without being talented into {{ site.data.spell.primordial_wave }} these bonuses do nothing.
Which means, we're forced into taking this talent for the next tier.

The reworked 4p also puts all of its emphasis on {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}, killing the "weaving" we expected with the first iterations.

## 2p
The additional damage from {{ site.data.spell.eb }} on {{ site.data.spell.primordial_wave }} is a great way to improve the immediate value and feel of the talent.
While applying {{ site.data.spell.fs }} is a good feature to have, adding the damage makes casting it so much more rewarding.

Furthermore this effect grants all three {{ site.data.spell.eb }} buffs. These present a sizeable chunk of stats.

The additional {{ site.data.spell.eb }} is cast for free. And there exist multiple talents triggered by casting {{ site.data.spell.eb }}.
Here is a table of them and whether they are triggered by the 2p effect.

Talent | 2p can trigger it
--- | ---
{{ site.data.spell.sop }} | ✅ yes
{{ site.data.spell.lr }} | ✅ yes
{{ site.data.spell.mwf }} | ✅ yes
{{ site.data.spell.fb }} | ✅ yes
{{ site.data.spell.wlr }} | ✅ yes

## 4p

Any kind of weaving is now gone and you just want to press {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} all day everyday.

Concerning the burn added to {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}, {{ site.data.spell.t31_4 }}, it functions similarly to Mage's [ignite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=12654/ignite). It stacks and extends itself if another {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} is used while the target is burning. That's pretty neat and you don't have to play around the debuff duration.

The recent changes to the 4p make {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} strong enough to warrant using it even when more than 4 targets are present.

## Conclusion

With the recent change to {{ site.data.spell.splinter }}, Wildfire builds will be more palatable in ST. We also gain very efficient Cleave thanks to our 4p, allowing us to be a bit of everything with just fire builds.
The newly introduced cap to {{ site.data.spell.fb }} also limits the time we spend in Ascendance, making the gameplay less... single minded.

This tier set is really strong and you'll now be pressing {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} at almost all targets count without losing too much DPS. The general access we get to {{ site.data.spell.pw }} also finally give us more than decent cleave and even give us a real niche in spread cleave on 2-5 targets. I just hope you enjoy pressing {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} two out of three globals.

Thanks for your time,<br/>
