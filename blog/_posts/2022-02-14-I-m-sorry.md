**Talents** 
- {{ site.data.spell.er }}
- {{ site.data.spell.afs }}
- {{ site.data.spell.se }}
- {{ site.data.spell.pe }}
- {{ site.data.spell.up }}

**APL**
1. {{ site.data.spell.se }}
1. {{ site.data.spell.fae_transfusion }}
1. {{ site.data.spell.fs }}, if `<`5.4s remaining
1. {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}
1. {{ site.data.spell.es }}
1. {{ site.data.spell.lb }}

That's it. That's the full apl with all necessary conditions.

# Unpacking the mess
Let me start with apologizing to everyone.

```
I'm very sorry.
Sorry for saying 'MACHINE GUN' would be a meme.
Sorry for noticing this abomination this late.
Sorry for your health (fingers).
Sorry for your keyboards.
```

While writing [this blogpost]({% link blog/_posts/2022-02-11-up-and-coming-memes.md %}) I didn't realize yet that the `MACHINE GUN`
would be an actual build. Well, it is.

## Storm Elemental uptime
This whole build depends on reaching 100% uptime on {{ site.data.spell.se }} without having to commit to hardcasted {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}.
Why not hardcasting {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}? 
Because {{ site.data.spell.lb }} with 20 stacks of {{ site.data.spell.wind_gust }} is just as strong.
Even with {{ site.data.item.t28_2 }} active.

Alright so what do we need to reach 100% uptime?
- {{ site.data.expansion_feature.sl.legendary.night_fae }}
- {{ site.data.conduit.essential_extraction }}
- {{ site.data.item.t28_4 }}
- 800+ {{ site.data.spell.mastery }} rating
- as many {{ site.data.spell.lava_surge }} empowered {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} as possible

The last bullet point is achieved by:
- {{ site.data.spell.fs }}
- {{ site.data.item.t28_2 }}
- {{ site.data.expansion_feature.sl.legendary.wlr }}

VoilÃ . We've reached 100% reliably. Yes, **without** {{ site.data.conduit.call_of_flame }}.

## Connecting the dots
Once we're at 20 stacks of {{ site.data.spell.wind_gust }}, we want to cast as many 0.5-0.8 second casttime {{ site.data.spell.lb }} as possible.

The following substitutions for our usual gameplay can be made.
- {{ site.data.spell.er }} instead of {{ site.data.spell.eote }}
- {{ site.data.spell.afs }} instead of {{ site.data.spell.eb }}
- {{ site.data.spell.up }} instead of {{ site.data.spell.sk }}
- {{ site.data.conduit.pyroclastic_shock }} instead of {{ site.data.spell.fs }}

While we told you in the past, that all the things we're replacing now were good, introducing permanent 20 stacks of {{ site.data.spell.wind_gust }}
changes the game.

{{ site.data.spell.eote }} makes our core proc feel meaningful and prevents waste.
But if we're solely interested in {{ site.data.spell.lava_surge }} empowered {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} casts anyway, we no longer need to prevent that waste.
Instead we can grab the free passive damage offered by {{ site.data.spell.er }}.

{{ site.data.spell.eb }} prevents us from casting empowered {{ site.data.spell.lb }}.
On the other hand {{ site.data.spell.afs }} directly offers more {{ site.data.spell.es }} casts, triggering {{ site.data.expansion_feature.sl.legendary.wlr }}, 
therefore generating more {{ site.data.spell.lava_surge }} empowered {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}, thus more uptime. 
But to be fair, {{ site.data.spell.eb }} is only slightly behind.

{{ site.data.spell.sk }} is usually not a choice but a must-have. But what does it offer for single target? 
We invest one GCD of casttime.
We get
- 3 additional {{ site.data.spell.lb }}
- enforcing {{ site.data.spell.mastery }} on the above and the baseline two {{ site.data.spell.lb }}
- next two {{ site.data.spell.lb }} are instant, somewhat negating the invested casttime

Compared to the other talents in that row this is a good trade.
Now back to introducing permanent 20 stacks of {{ site.data.spell.wind_gust }}.
Suddenly this investment GCD is worth ~2 {{ site.data.spell.lb }}.
This lowers the value a lot because the time gained on those instant {{ site.data.spell.lb }}s is a lot less now.
Additionally there exists a talent on that row, that **loves** haste and equivalent effects.
{{ site.data.spell.up }} rejoices at the sight of more (potentially) overloading casts within 10 seconds.
Going from ~6.6 casts per 10 seconds to up to 14 **is** quite the jump.
This averages out to 1.5 stacks over the whole fight. 3% might not seem like a lot.
But...it's still more than what the other talents offer.

Lastly {{ site.data.conduit.pyroclastic_shock }}. A Conduit that didn't see the light of play yet.
When we want to solely focus on casting {{ site.data.spell.es }}, {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}, and {{ site.data.spell.lb }},
and the later being able to be cast roughly twice during a normal GCD spending time casting {{ site.data.spell.fs }} becomes quite the drawback.
Alleviating this drawback is all this Conduit is about. It's worth it.

## Downgrading alternatives
- {{ site.data.conduit.call_of_flame }} instead of {{ site.data.conduit.high_voltage }} in case you don't have enough {{ site.data.spell.mastery }}
- {{ site.data.spell.sk }} in case you require AoE burst

# How to deal with button spamming
While these suggestions might seem stupid, written with tongue in cheek, or straight up a joke, I mean them in the most sincere way.
Once you've destroyed your finger joints, there is no going back.

**[EDIT]**: Blizzards stance on using external tools is...opaque. You might risk getting banned. Be careful with your health and monitor the condition of your joints.

## Multiple different keybinds
Bind {{ site.data.spell.lb }} to multiple different keys to distribute spamming them over multiple fingers.

## Rapid fire functionality on a mouse button
Some mouse (-drivers) offer the ability to rapid-fire click a button.
Bind {{ site.data.spell.lb }} to that button and just keep it pressed when you need to spam the spell.

**[EDIT]**: Blizzards stance on using external tools is...opaque. You might risk getting banned. Be careful with your health and monitor the condition of your joints.

## Scroll wheel without resistance
Some mouse don't have a "click"-resistance when using their scroll-wheel. Some mouse can enable and disable this feature.
Bind {{ site.data.spell.lb }} to scroll-up or -down. And spin to win.

## Pedal
![pedal image](https://coachdaveacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-image-bestcheappedalst3pa.jpg)
Get a pedal. Set it up to be spamming {{ site.data.spell.lb }} while pressing down one of them.

# But the apl doesn't specify Lava Surge
Indeed. And it doesn't need to. 
The combination of {{ site.data.item.t28_2 }} and {{ site.data.expansion_feature.sl.legendary.wlr }} will ensure basically zero hardcasted {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}.

Prepare yourself.

Yours sincerely,<br/>
