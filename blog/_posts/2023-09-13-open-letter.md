Hello Shaman Community,

As a recent addition the Earthshrine MVP and Mod team, I always wanted to create some sort of Open Letter that would summarize my different takes on the spec.
Also, as a fairly new Elemental Shaman who only picked up the spec in Saison 4 of Shadowlands, I might see thing somewhat differently from my peers.

The goal of this post is by no mean to give solutions but rather to point out the different pain points that you currently encounter while playing Elemental Shaman.

## Storm Elemental and Fire Elemental
- Storm Elemental and Fire Elemental are the primary offensive CD. They are the equivalent of Retribution's Avenging Wrath, Demonology's Summon Tyrant or Balance's Eclipse.
- Yet their power are massively underwhelming. At the moment, they are a button you press every 2 minutes and a half that almost do not interact with our gameplay and rotation, and passively deal 5% of our damage.
- Actually, fire Elemental has the real good upside of doubling FS duration, making it possible for us to focus on CL and EQ, instead of permanently refreshing FS. But in my opinion, the only reason Fire Ele feels good, is because FS usually feels bad and is better during this CD.


## Utility

Shaman is known among the community as the utility beast. Whenever Shaman's utility get discussed, you always hear people say that we have so many tools for so many situations, and that their class would be happy to bring them. Let's dive into our utility, we'll see what we can make of it.

### Raid Utility

Currently, there's no real reason for a guild to want an Elemental Shaman. Our 3 main utility in raid are {{ site.data.talent.wrt }}, {{ site.data.talent.ag }} and {{ site.data.talent.mana_spring }}.

Let's talk about {{ site.data.talent.wrt }} first. While it is nice to have, it doesn't hold a candle compared to {{ site.data.externals.stampeding_roar }}. Stampeding Roar, with the [Improved Stampeding Roar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288826/improved-stampeding-roar) talent, gives 20% more movement speed, has 1 minute CD and lasts longer. If your raid has two Druids, you essentially never need to press {{ site.data.talent.wrt }} and your raid will have a movement buff every time it needs it. The small advantage that {{ site.data.talent.wrt }} holds over {{ site.data.externals.stampeding_roar }} is {{ site.data.talent.totemic_projection }}, allowing you to relocate it on your group during and after movement, extending its effect.

Second is {{ site.data.talent.ag }}, which is really strong paired with your CD. Problem is, and we'll come back to this, Elemental Shaman doesn't really have a huge CD to pair with {{ site.data.talent.ag }}. The best candidate to use with it is {{ site.data.talent.sk }}, but in Single target, it's not really anything major. It's also a CD that was recently nerfed for its power in dungeon, which was probably too good in that scenario, but leaves a bad aftertaste in raid. It's also worth mentioning that you don't control who it heals. This result in {{ site.data.talent.ag }} massively overhealing in most instances (from checking a few logs, it ranges from 40% to 75% overheal, usually around 50%).

Last is {{ site.data.talent.mana_spring }}. With the last 10.2 nerf, we now give 100 mana to 4 allies per {{ site.data.spell.lvb }}. From our early test, being in fire build, we average 30 {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} cast per minute. Which means {{ site.data.talent.mana_spring }} gives 3k mana to 4 allies in 1 minute. For reference, a Restoration Shaman's [Riptide](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295/riptide) costs 4k mana. We give, on average in a fire build, less than 1 cast per minute to each healer with {{ site.data.talent.mana_spring }}.


### Dungeon utility
- Chain Heal with Maelstrom Weapon
- AG nerf
- Thundershock very ranged unfriendly?

### The "useless" utility
- PCT
- Stone skin totem
- Tranquil air totem
- hst (god)
- 2 earth shields
- Earthgrab totem

### Enhancement and Restoration

So Shaman's utility isn't really good when compared to other classes tools in raid. But what about the same class? Well it gets even worse. Enhancement brings {{ site.data.externals.wft }}, restoration brings both {{ site.data.externals.slt }} and {{ site.data.externals.apt }}. While Restoration's case is an entire different matter and it could be argue that both {{ site.data.externals.slt }} and {{ site.data.externals.apt }} are underwhelming, Enhancement brings a massive party buff, while also giving everything Elemental will ever bring.

One of the recurring answer when talking about Elemental Shaman Utility and how to fix it is "just give them {{ site.data.talent.skyfury_totem }}". In my opinion, that's a terrible take.

### Utility's conclusion

So why do you have an Elemental Shaman in your group? Mostly two reasons: either the person playing it is an Elemental Shaman enjoyer, or Elemental Shaman is tuned really high and does the most damage. The last time the second reason was true was in Crucible of Storms, in 8.1.5, more than 4 years ago.

To be clear, I don't want to make Elemental Shaman mandatory in every raid. It's about altering the community perception to a point where people donâ€™t feel terrible for bringing one. Right now, I feel terrible to be an Elemental Shaman and my guild asked me multiple times If I was okay to switch. Because we're are lacking good players and me switching would help fill up the raid buff requirement. There are multiple ways to alter community perception. The most recent example is the change to [Hunter's Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257284/hunters-mark). This simple damage gain from being your guild's hunter is all I ask for Elemental Shaman.


## Earthquake and Spenders in general

## Build Splits, Fire and Lightning don't really coexist

## Flame Shock
- How the hell are you supposed to spread it??? Compare it to pr

## Fire ST // AoE
- It's impossible to talent both ST and AoE as fire when PSurge/SpE are a choice node and SFD is so down to the side

## Cleave, Chain Lightning and spreading FS

## Ascendance, why it sucks, and why FB sucks even more
- DRE in a similar style to SKB?


## Rotation in lightning build is very static, feels overwhelming to learn and underwhelming to perform.

## Spenders ?
- EB not being instant is disliked a lot

## Icefury

## Tankyness
- Spirit Wolf is a problem

## Class tree / Dead Talent Points / Earth Elemental
- Tranquil air Totem

## Spec tree
- 23 possible points below the 3rd gate, 25
