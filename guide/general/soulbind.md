Here I will give some more detailed opinions on the different soulbinds and covenant options.

If you are just interested in the sim dps of each soulbind skip to [the charts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/general/soulbind_charts.md %})

![Kyrian_IMG]({{ "assets/img/guide/Kyrian_Sigil.png" | absolute_url}})__Kyrian__

#### Pelagos: 
He is dead.
Mastery from {{site.data.soulbinds.combat_meditation}} is bad in all types of content and Magic Damage Taken Decrease from {{site.data.soulbinds.let_go_of_the_past}} is pretty much useless as well.

#### Kleia:
She is a healing soulbind.
Skip

#### Forgelite Prime Mikanikos:
Finally a good soulbind for Kyrian.
{{site.data.soulbinds.brons_call_to_action}} can be a nice form of CC especially in M+. In raids it might be a bad thing to accidentially cc targets that are supposed to be moved.
It also deals pretty good damage.
Additionally {{site.data.soulbinds.hammer_of_genesis}} grants you 3% Haste for 10 seconds whenever you damage a new target, which can be incredibly strong on encounters with add waves.

## Conclusion:
Pick Forgelite in pretty much all cases.

![Necrolord_IMG]({{ "assets/img/guide/Death_Lords_Sigil.png" | absolute_url}})__Necrolords__

#### Plague Deviser Marileth:
The worst Necrolord Soulbind.
{{site.data.soulbinds.preemptive_strike}} is the only ability in this tree that actually affects your damage by increasing the damage done to a new target by 10% for 10 seconds.
Sadly Elemental doesn't have a very good single target burst, so it falls behind the alternatives.

#### Emeni:
Even after the Nerf Emeni is propably one of the best soulbinds in the game.
If {{site.data.soulbinds.lead_by_example}} affects 4 other people, it elevates her to the best soulbind in general. 
Gnashing Chompers is sadly not that easily simmed but will likely be worse than the additional potency conduit.

#### Bonesmith Heirmir:
Heirmir is the alternative if Emeni isn't consistently affecting enough friendlies in a fight.
{{site.data.soulbinds.marrowed_gemstone}} is incredibly strong in AoE and mythic+.
In addition to all of this Heirmir can run 2 Defensive and 1 Utility Conduit while running the highest possible damage path.
On top of all of this {{site.data.soulbinds.forgeborne_reveries}} might enable you to clutch a kill, especially with it being able to proc twice after using  {{site.data.spell.ankh}}.


## Conclusion:

Pick Emeni when you haven't unlocked {{site.data.soulbinds.marrowed_gemstone}} yet.

After that pick Heirmir in M+ and when not able to consistently get 4 stacks on {{site.data.soulbinds.lead_by_example}}.

![Venthyr_IMG]({{ "assets/img/guide/Venthyr_Sigil.png" | absolute_url}})__Venthyr__

#### Nadjia The Mistblade:

{{site.data.soulbinds.thrill_seeker}} is potentially a very strong ability on some of the raid fights in Nathria, with frequent add waves.
We are gonna have to keep an eye on uptime on this one.
{{site.data.soulbinds.dauntless_duelist}} is on the contrary build for single target fights.


#### Theotar The Mad Duke:

{{site.data.soulbinds.soothing_shade}} gives us mastery. Meh
{{site.data.soulbinds.wasteland_propriety}} gives us and 4 nearby allies versatility. Not entirely bad but it does cost us a Potency slot.
All in all Theotar is subpar and doesn't offer anything interesting.


#### General Draven:

{{site.data.soulbinds.built_for_war}} sims relatively well but will perform far worse in most types of relevant content.
All in all Draven is a tank soulbind.
Skip


## Conclusion: 

Overall Nadjia is propably the best out of the Venthyr soulbinds.

![NF_IMG]({{ "assets/img/guide/Fae_Sigil.png" | absolute_url}})__Night Fae__

#### Niya:

Niya is an incredibly potent soulbind.
It is the highest simming across all covenants in single target, because {{site.data.soulbinds.burrs}} is just that powerful.
Sadly this only becomes available with the full tree unlocked.

#### Dreamweaver:

An interesting soulbind in that it is the only one that has two potency conduits unlocked in week 4.
{{site.data.soulbinds.field_of_blossom}} isn't bad in AoE but get's outshone by Korayn.

#### Korayn:

The highest skill cap soulbind.
{{site.data.soulbinds.wild_hunt_tactics}} is incredibly potent dps-wise, but because most fights become progressively harder, in practice it's slightly worse than sims would indicate.
{{site.data.soulbinds.first_strike}} grants 25% crit chance for 5 sec after damaging a new target that hasn't damaged you before.
This can be heavily abused in m+ by chain pulling new small mobs on top of a big main target.
Because EQ is not target capped we do not profit as much off of it as other specs do though.

## Conclusion:
Dreamweaver while it gives you an extra potency conduit.

Korayn for mythic+ and raids with waves of adds.

Niya for single target.
