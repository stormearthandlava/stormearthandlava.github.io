This page has the answers to some frequently asked questions for Elemental Shamans.

### Q: "Will Elemental be viable in Dragonflight 10.1.0?"
* Firstly, no spec in the game is unviable. Certain specs may be favored for certain bosses in a raid, but this is only relevant to the very highest end of raiding (i.e, competing for world first). Elemental (and every other spec) will remain competitive for 99.9% of the player base.
* With that being said, Elemental's more versatile than it was in Season 1:
  - Changes to the Class Tree give us more points to use in it.
  - The ST and the Hybrid build share 28 out of 30 talent points in the spec tree, making it very easy to switch from one to the other without losing much.
  - Sadly, the rotation for that build can be tricky to learn, and will make us way less mobile than in S1.
  - Lastly, we still don't bring any relevant raid utility, meaning we are highly dependent on tuning to get a raid spot.
* You can check all of Elemental's changes for 10.1 in this [Changelog]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link blog/_posts/2023-04-02-10.1-change-collection.md %}) post.

### Q: "What do all these abbreviations mean? I can't understand other Elemental Shaman!"
* It can be tough trying to learn all of them at once but there is a handy resource to help you! See [Elemental Abbreviations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link blog/_posts/2023-01-23-ele101.md %}).

### Q: "What does {{ site.data.spell.fol }} actually reduce?"
* For a complete list, see the [Flash of Lightning]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link blog/_posts/2023-01-23-fol.md %}) post.

### Q: "Do you have any recommendation on how to sim and profiles to use while simming?"
* For a complete guide about Elemental's sim, see [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link blog/_posts/2023-01-02-simming.md %}).

### Q: "What Pots/Food/Phials should I use?"
* See the [Consumables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/general/consumables.md %}) section of the guide.

### Q: "Does {{ site.data.spell.eq }} stack?"
* Yes, {{ site.data.spell.eq }} stacks and has no stack limit. Also Haste doesn't affect its tick rate.

### Q: "What is funnelling?"
* Funnel means you are utilizing multiple targets to put more damage into a priority target or a boss. In Elemental Shaman's case, it can either refer to:
- Casting {{ site.data.spell.fs }} on multiple targets in order to generate {{ site.data.spell.lvs }} procs or {{ site.data.spell.magma_chamber }} Stacks.
- Casting {{ site.data.spell.cl }} to generate more Maelstrom in cleave situation then use this maelstrom with {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and {{ site.data.spell.sop }} {{ site.data.spell.lb }}.

### Q: "Is there a point where I don't cast {{ site.data.spell.es }} with {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} talented?"
* **No**, unless you have {{ site.data.spell.eb }} talented, you always alternate {{ site.data.spell.es }} and {{ site.data.spell.eq }}.

### Q: "Okay, so what about {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and/or {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} then?!"
* **Yes**, these talent choices do impact your spender use:
   - If you have taken {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and *not* {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} then you will use {{ site.data.spell.eb }} at 3 and less targets, {{ site.data.spell.eq }} at 4 targets and more.
   - If you have taken {{ site.data.spell.eb }} *and* {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} then you will use {{ site.data.spell.eb }} at 1 target, then alternate {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and {{ site.data.spell.eq }} at 2 targets and more.

### Q: "How many targets should I cast {{ site.data.spell.fs }} on?"
* See the Priority List for each build in the [Build]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/general/builds.md %}) section of the guide.

### Q: "When do I cast {{ site.data.spell.cl }}?"
* {{ site.data.spell.cl }} replaces {{ site.data.spell.lb }} as a filler from 2 or more targets.

### Q: "What about with {{ site.data.spell.sk }}?"
* With {{ site.data.spell.sop }} talented:
  - 1-2 targets = {{ site.data.spell.lb }} with {{ site.data.spell.sop }} buff active.
  - 3-5 targets = {{ site.data.spell.cl }} or {{ site.data.spell.lvbm }} with {{ site.data.spell.mote }} buff active.
  - 6+ targets = {{ site.data.spell.cl }} or {{ site.data.spell.lvbm }} with {{ site.data.spell.sop }} buff active.
* Without {{ site.data.spell.sop }}:
  - 1 target = {{ site.data.spell.lb }} with {{ site.data.spell.mote }} buff active.
  - 2+ targets {{ site.data.spell.cl }} or {{ site.data.spell.lvbm }} with {{ site.data.spell.mote }} buff active.

### Q: "When is the best time to use Primal Fire Elemental's {{ site.data.spell.meteor }} and Primal Storm Elemental's {{ site.data.spell.tempest }}?"
* When they would hit the most targets. For {{ site.data.spell.tempest }} specifically, you need to ensure it is also fully buffed by {{ site.data.spell.call_lightning }}.  
*Note: This only applies when talented into {{ site.data.spell.pe }}. Both abilities can be macro'd. See useful macros further down.*

### Q: "Do I use {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} during {{ site.data.spell.se }}?"
* {{ site.data.spell.se }} does not alter the rotation for the builds that use it. During its duration, you will typically behave the same regardless of it being active.

### Q: "What trinkets should I aim for as an Elemental Shaman?"
* For a complete guide about Elemental's trinket, see [Trinket]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/general/trinkets.md %}) section of the guide.

### Q: "What are some useful Macros?"
* See the [Macros]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/general/macros.md %}) section of the guide.
