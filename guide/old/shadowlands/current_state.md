This page is intended to provide you a complete overview about every ability, spell, talent, and effect that affects Elemental Shamans throughout the development process of Shadowlands. Everything you can read here was confirmed ingame or we're in the process of confirming it. For now we're refraining from posting datamined information to be able to provide correct information to you. Datamining is great and very helpful, but can have some misleading sideeffects, when some things were experimented with, discarded and forgotten in the data, but suddenly datamining picks them up and gets everyone hyped for stuff, that isn't even meant to go live.

10.04.2020: Information for the first version of this site were gathered with the help of Rezyn#3520.

## Special Remarks and Tests

### Flame Shock
Compared to Battle for Azeroth Flame Shock ticks only every 3 seconds instead of 2 seconds baseline. If you add the removal of Igneous Potential the frequency at which you gain Lava Surge procs is further reduced. Assuming 40% Haste:

| Expansion | Calculation | Procs per minute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Battle for Azeroth | `60s / (2s / 1.4) * 0.18` | 7.56 |
| Shadowlands | `60s / (3s / 1.4) * 0.15` | 4.2 |

This will result in a noticeable drop in procs, which feels like a slowdown while playing.


### Fulmination
- is not affected by Elemental Fury (+50% crit damage)
- Strange damage curve

| Stack count | damage | crit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 94 | |
| 2 | 141 | |
| 3 | 188 | |
| 4 | 237 | 473 |
| 5 | 283 | |
| 6 | 331 | |
| 7 | 377 | |
| 8 | 426 | 852 |


### Searing Totem
- [Bug] is not attacking target dummies
> My tests!?

### Elemental Blast
- Overloads still create their own buff
- Additional buffs can only have different stats
- [Bug] Mastery buff was not seen to trigger
- [Bug?] Only **two buffs** can be active at the same time (probably just the result of the former line)
- Aweful gameplay with Surge of Power: Do you delay EB? Do you disregard SoP? Totem Mastery becomes mandatory to increase Fulmination generation


### Echoing Shock
- Spell is not affected by Master of the Elements
- Spell is not affected by Elemental Fury
- Echoing Shock buff is consumed on **cast hit**
    - this results in quite strange consumptions for casts with travel time like Elemental Blast (EB -> Echoing Shock = Echoing Shock is consumed by the EB hit and doubles it)
    - Casts without visual travel time like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning still consume Echoing Shock, if Echoing Shock was cast right after casting them (LB/CL -> Echoing Shock = Echoing Shock is consumed)
    - to properly use Echoing Shock with casts with casttime you have to first cast the to-be-doubled cast and Echoing Shock afterwards
- Echoed cast is an independant event (can crit, can overload, can buff)
- Echoes of a Master of the Elements empowered casts are no longer empowered by Master of the Elements
- Echoed Lightning Bolt while Stormkeeper was still active was buffed without consuming a buff (SK -> Echoing Shock -> LB)
- Echoed Frost Shock while Icefury was still active was buffed without consuming a buff (IF -> Echoing Shock -> FrS)
- Echoed Flame Shock refreshes with pandemic
- Echoed Earthquake is cast at the same location of the original
- With SoP talented you can actually cast ES (6+ Fulmination) -> LB, and get two empowered LBs, thus up a sum of up to 6 Overloads from this one LB and its Echo
- ES (6+F) -> SK -> Echoing Shock -> LB -> LB = 3 empowered LB and up to 7 empowered Overloads

Does **not** affect:
- Ascendance
- Earth Elemental
- Fire Elemental
- [Bug?] Fulmination
- [Bug] Lava Burst
- Liquid Magma Totem
- Searing Totem
- Spiritwalker's Grace

Affects:
- Earth Shock
- Earthquake
- Elemental Blast
- Flame Shock
- Frost Shock
- Icefury
- Lightning Bolt
- Thunderstorm


### Totem Mastery
- stacks Fulmination outfight [that's as op as it sounds]


### Master of Elements
Affects:
- Chain Lightning
- Earth Shock
- Earthquake
- Frost Shock
- Lightning Bolt
- [T] Elemental Blast
- [T] Icefury

Does **not** affect:
- Fulmination
- Primal Strike
- [T] Echoing Shock


### Surge of Power
- [Bug] always enabled even if you select a different talent
    - Lava Burst portion of the talent is only active if the actual talent is enabled

Phew, that's it for now...
